# Installation 

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and execute in the shell:

```bash
make run
```

If poetry is not your thing `:(`, you can simply install the dependencies ( [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)) and execute:

```bash
python -m discrete_events
```
